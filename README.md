# Wandboard-Enclosure
3D drawing of a Wandboard enclosure adjusted for 3D printing
  
Made with Solid Edge.  
  
Only slight changes has been made to the downloadable 3D drawing at the wandboard download page:  
http://wandboard.org/index.php/downloads  
  
Changes are:  
- Made top flat, to allow that part to be printed  
- Added two protrusions with holes that can be used to screw it to a wall  
- Made a hole for antenna (in a different location than can be cut out in the original version)

NOTE! The walls are very thin, and we saw quite some problems with printing it. Parts fell off which I had to forge back using a soldering iron. Also, there is currently a small issue that the holes for the protrusions cut through both sides of the top part.  
  
Four 10mm M2.5 screws works well to keep the top and bottom parts together

Tested with Wandboard Quad (with the large heatsinks)
  
Thanks to Martijn Sanderse for printing it for me!
