# Wandboard-Enclosure
3D drawing of a Wandboard enclosure adjusted for 3D printing
  
Made with Solid Edge.  
  
Only slight changes has been made to the downloadable 3D drawing at the wandboard download page:  
http://wandboard.org/index.php/downloads  
  
Changes are:  
- Made top flat, to allow that part to be printed  
- Added two protrusions with holes that can be used to screw it to a wall  
- Made a hole for antenna (in a different location than can be cut out in the original version)

NOTE! The walls are very thin, and we saw quite some problems with printing it. Parts fell off which I had to glue back using a soldering iron. Also, there is currently a small issue that the holes for the protrusions cut through both sides of the top part.  
  
Thanks to Martijn Sanderse for printing it for me!
